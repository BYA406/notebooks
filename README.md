# Trading Economics Notebooks

The Trading Economics Notebooks GitHub repository showcases examples on how you can easily interact with our data to make interesting data findings and insights. You have 3 alternatives to get started:


## Trading Economics Jupyter Hub

Register for **free** at http://jupyter.tradingeconomics.com/, a web-based interactive development environment that gets you started very quickly without the need to install any software in your computer. Our Jupyter Lab lets you try the examples shown above but not only. You can also create, store and share your own notebooks with your colleagues. Our web interface also sets you up with a special API access key that unlocks many of our premium datasets.

## Local Development

Users also have the choice to fork and clone this repository into their local computer. Be aware that if you just clone it you will not be able to push changes into our master branch. Thus forking is probably better as it allows you to add new files and push changes. Consider the jupyter:jupyer key used in our examples is set to only work in our web-based interface. For some datasets using guest:guest can work. But the best path is for you to signup at https://developer.tradingeconomics.com/ to get your own API key.


``` git clone https://github.com/tradingeconomics/notebooks ```
