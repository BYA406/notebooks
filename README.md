# Trading Economics Notebooks

The Trading Economics Notebooks GitHub repository showcases examples on how you can easily interact with our data to make interesting data findings and insights.


## Getting started

Register for **free** at http://jupyter.tradingeconomics.com/, a web-based interactive development environment that gets you started very quickly without the need to install any software in your computer. Our Jupyter Lab lets you try the examples shown above with a special API access key that unlocks many of our premium datasets. You can also create, store and share your own notebooks with your colleagues. Consider that our examples are read-only but you can edit them and save them as as new files in your root home folder.

## Going further

Fork this repository if you want to store your changes and experiment without affecting the original project. Then pull your forked repository into our Jupyter instance or into your local computer. Consider the special key jupyter:jupyter unlocks most of the data but is set to only work in our web-based interface. ``` git clone https://github.com/{YourGitHubUsername}/notebooks ```

## Local Development

Users also have the choice to fork and clone this repository into their local computer. Be aware that if you just clone it you will not be able to push changes into our master branch. Thus forking is probably better as it allows you to add new files and push changes. Consider the jupyter:jupyter key used in our examples is set to only work in our web-based interface. For some datasets using guest:guest can work. But the best path is for you to signup at https://developer.tradingeconomics.com/ to get your own API key.


``` git clone https://github.com/tradingeconomics/notebooks ```
