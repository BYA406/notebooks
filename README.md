# Trading Economics Notebooks

The Trading Economics Python Jupyter Notebooks showcase examples on how you can easily interact with our data to make interesting data findings and insights. 
Trading Economics is a gateway to 20 million indicators from 196 countries. You get free access to datasets from the Worldbank, the United Nations, the Federal Reserve, the EUROSTAT, and much more.  Trading Economics also provides its subscribers with a near real-time economic calendar updated 24 hours a day, historical data time series sourced recently and directly from national statistics offices, quotes for thousands of financial markets, and active support.

Users also have the choice to fork and clone this repository into your local computer. Be aware that if you just clone it you will not be able to push changes into our master branch. Thus forking is probably better as it allows you to add new files and push changes. Consider the jupyter:jupyer key used in our examples is set to only work in our web based interface. For some datasets using guest:guest can work. But the best path is for you to signup at https://developer.tradingeconomics.com/ to get your own API key.


The Trading Economics API and its data is also available for other programming languages.
