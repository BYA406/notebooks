# Trading Economics Notebooks

The Trading Economics Notebooks GitHub repository showcases examples on how you can easily interact with our data to make interesting data findings and insights. 
Trading Economics is a gateway to 20 million indicators from 196 countries. You get free access to datasets from the Worldbank, the United Nations, the Federal Reserve, the EUROSTAT, and much more.  Trading Economics also provides its subscribers with a near real-time economic calendar updated 24 hours a day, historical data time series sourced recently and directly from national statistics offices, quotes for thousands of financial markets, and active support. 


You have 3 alternatives to get started:


## Trading Economics Jupyter Hub

Register for **free** at http://jupyter.tradingeconomics.com/, a web-based interactive development environment that gets you started very quickly without the need to install any software in your computer. Our Jupyer Lab lets you try the examples shown above. You can also create, store and share your own notebooks with your colleagues. Our web interface also sets you up with a special API access key that unlocks many of our premium datasets.

## Local Development

Users also have the choice to fork and clone this repository into their local computer. Be aware that if you just clone it you will not be able to push changes into our master branch. Thus forking is probably better as it allows you to add new files and push changes. Consider the jupyter:jupyer key used in our examples is set to only work in our web-based interface. For some datasets using guest:guest can work. But the best path is for you to signup at https://developer.tradingeconomics.com/ to get your own API key.
